### Features

- [ ] TypeScript: Fully typed, ensuring robust code.
- [ ] Class-based Architecture: Clean separation of concerns using classes for controllers, routers, and services.
- [ ] Middleware: Pre-configured for JSON parsing, URL encoding, and more.
- [ ] Environment Configuration with DotEnv: Stores custom constant configurations within process.env using the DotEnv package.
- [ ] API Documentation: Integrate Swagger or another API documentation tool to generate interactive API documentation automatically.
- [ ] API Versioning: Implement API versioning to ensure backward compatibility for older API clients.
- [ ] Caching: Implements caching for Node.js with support for Valkey/KeyDB.
- [ ] Routing: Separates routes into Web Routes and API Routes for better organization.
- [ ] Route Authentication Middleware: Secures Web routes with CSRF Tokens and API routes with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- [ ] Unit & Integration Testing: Add comprehensive testing using frameworks like Jest or Mocha for better reliability.
- [ ] Database Migration Tool: Include a database migration tool like knex or sequelize-cli to manage schema changes.
- [ ] Health Check & Monitoring Tools: Easy Integration of tools like Prometheus or Datadog for monitoring application health and performance.
- [ ] Background Queues: Implements background job processing.
- [ ] Logging Interceptor: Adds a logging interceptor using Winston for better log management.
- [ ] PostgreSQL Atomic Queries: Allows execution of atomic PostgreSQL queries on demand.
- [ ] Configurable Connection Pools: Enables customizable connection pools for backend storage systems.
- [ ] Rate Limiting: Implement a rate-limiting feature to protect against abuse by limiting the number of requests per user.
- [ ] Global Handlers: Centralized response and error handling middleware.
- [ ] Graceful Shutdown: Smooth server shutdown on termination signals.
- [ ] Multi-language Support: Add support for internationalization (i18n) to make the application available in multiple languages.

### Getting Started

    #### Prerequisites

    - Node.js (v16.x or higher)
    - npm or yarn
    - Docker (optional, for containerization)


    #### Installation
    
    Configuration: The application uses environment variables for configuration. Create a .env file at the root of the project and add the necessary variables from `.env.template` for successful execution in dev/production env.

    Steps to setup the code:
        1. Clone the repository

        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/shravan20/neonode-quick-starter.git
        cd neonode-quick-starter
        ```

        2. Install dependencies

        ```sh
        npm install
        ```

        3. Running Locally

        ```sh
        npm run dev
        ```

        This will start the development server with hot-reloading.

        4. Running in Production

        ```sh
        npm run build && npm start
        ```
