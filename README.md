### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

    - Node.js (v16.x or higher)
    - npm or yarn
    - Docker (optional, for containerization)

#### Installation

Configuration: The application uses environment variables for configuration. Create a .env file at the root of the project and add the necessary variables from `.env.template` for successful execution in dev/production env.

Steps to setup the code:

  1. Clone the repository

        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/shravan20/neonode-quick-starter.git
        cd neonode-quick-starter
        ```

  2. Install dependencies

        ```sh
        npm install
        ```

  3. Running Locally

        ```sh
        npm run dev
        ```

        This will start the development server with hot-reloading.

  4. Running in Production

        ```sh
        npm run build && npm start
        ```
